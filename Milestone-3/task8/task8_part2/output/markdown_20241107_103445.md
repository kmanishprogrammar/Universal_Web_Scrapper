#### Scale plan



Monthly





Annual




 When choosing
 **Scale plan** you pay for parallel running jobs.
 You can increase or decrease the number of parallel running scraping job count as to suit your
 needs.
 The plan has an unlimited number of cloud credits.
 



 The amount of URLs that can be scraped per month depends
 on parallel running job count, configured request interval, target site response speed and
 driver that is used to access the page.
 Full JS driver executes all JavaScript in a page while Fast driver skips JavaScript execution.
 


#### Scale plan price calculator




Parallel active job count:

\-
\+




| Price |  |
| --- | --- |
| Scraped URL count with Full JS driver |  |
| Scraped URL count with Fast driver |  |




Close









#### Custom proxy





 To reduce the price of the Scale plan we do not include a universal proxy service in the price
 of the plan.
 Instead, we provide you with an option to integrate your account with a third\-party proxy
 services
 so you can choose a proxy provider that matches your needs best and you only have to pay for
 what you use.
 



 When estimating proxy expenses you need to take into account the average page size.
 On average, a page scraped with Fast driver is 50\-150 KB in size and a page scraped with Full JS
 driver is 100\-300 KB in size.

### Diego Kremer


Simply AMAZING. Was thinking about coding myself a simple scraper for a project
 and then found this super easy to use and very powerful scraper. Worked
 perfectly with all the websites I tried on. Saves a lot of time. Thanks for
 that!

### Carlos Figueroa


Powerful tool that beats the others out there. Has a learning curve to it but
 once you conquer that the sky's the limit. Definitely a tool worth making a
 donation on and supporting for continued development. Way to go for the
 authoring crew behind this tool.

### Jonathan H


This is fantastic! I'm saving hours, possibly days. I was trying to scrap and old
 site, badly made, no proper divs or markup.

 Using the WebScraper magic, it somehow "knew" the pattern after I selected 2
 elements. Amazing.

 Yes, it's a learning curve and you HAVE to watch the video and read the docs.
 Don't rate it down just because you can't be bothered to learn it. If you put
 the effort in, this will save your butt one day!














## Frequently asked questions






### What is a Cloud/Page Credit?




A page credit represents a single page loaded by the Web Scraper Cloud.
 For example if the scraper has to go through 100 pages then 100 page credits
 will be charged.
 If you are extracting 100 records from a single page only one page credit
 will be charged.
 






### Will I be able to scrape a specific site?




From our own experience we can say that none of the universal web scraping
 tools can scrape every site.
 You have to try it out for yourself.
 Try Web Scraper Cloud for free with no investments.
 






### Do I need to input my credit card information to start free trial?




No.






### How Scale plan differs from other plans?




Scale plan is built for large volume scraping.
 It offers unlimited cloud credits with limited running scraping jobs that
 you can scale up or down as needed.
