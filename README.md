# 🌐 Universal Web Scraper 🚀  
> 📌 Infosys Springboard Internship Project (Certified Completion)  
> ✅ Python + Gemini Flash + Multi-format Data Export  

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project was built during my **Infosys Springboard Internship**, where I focused on developing a **robust and modular web scraping tool** capable of scraping data from complex directory-style websites and providing the results in various formats including **CSV**, **JSON**, and **XML**.

🎓 **Internship Focus Areas**:
- Web scraping dynamic & structured web pages
- Clean data storage and export
- UI/UX enhancements via Gemini Flash integration
- Modular, user-driven scraping pipeline

## 🧩 Milestone Breakdown

### 🥇 Milestone 1: Directory Website Scraper
- ✅ Scraped a complex directory-style website
- ✅ Extracted structured data (name, contact, address, etc.)
- ✅ Exported results into **CSV**

### 🥈 Milestone 2: Advanced Data Handling
- ✅ Handled pagination and nested elements
- ✅ Implemented error handling & logging
- ✅ Ensured scraping works even if structure changes slightly

### 🥉 Milestone 3: Universal Web Scraper (Gemini Flash UI)
- ✅ Built a **universal scraper** that:
  - Accepts **URL**
  - Accepts **fields to extract**
  - Accepts **model name (default: Gemini Flash)**
- ✅ Scrapes user-defined targets dynamically
- ✅ Exports data in **CSV, JSON, XML**
- ✅ User gets a **Download button** after scraping completes
